# Changelog - Accessibility Atlas

## 2026-02-19 - Pre-Publication Cleanup

### Removed
- `wlasl_index.csv` - Removed due to licensing restrictions (available separately at https://dxli94.github.io/WLASL/).
- `aac_vocabulary_data.json` - Removed due to mixed licensing (see GlobalSymbols at https://globalsymbols.com).

### Changed
- Updated dataset count from 55 to 53.
- Cleaned up `dataset_index.json` to reflect removed files.
- All remaining datasets verified for licensing compliance.

### Rationale
To ensure the dataset collection is fully compliant with Kaggle and HuggingFace terms of service, I removed files with restrictive licenses or unclear provenance. Users can still access these datasets directly from their original sources (linked in `dataset_index.json`).

## 2026-02-13 - Initial Collection

### Added
- 55 datasets across 16 categories.
- 10 analysis notebooks.
- Comprehensive documentation and metadata.
